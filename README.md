<h1>42-Piscine</h1>

**42-Piscine** is a programme conducted by *42KL*, a subsidiary group of the larger *42 Network*.

The *42 network* is a collection of coding schools that emphasizes on the philosophy of **self-learning**.

Above are the codes written for **42-Piscine**, a necessary programme for every student of *42KL* and all other similar schools to go through as part of the process of ascertaining whether the student is suitable for the school.

The coding is mainly done in **C** as it helps provide the student with a fundamental understanding of coding.

Students are expected to progress through a curriculum in a similar manner to that of **solving puzzles in a game**

The curriculum is segmented into multiple levels with *increasing difficulties*. Each level provides the student with a new, **"Subject PDF"** that details the tasks students have to to complete for that level and the requirements for each of those tasks

**Upon the completion** of a level, students may subscribe for an evaluation session. A random student will be assigned to evaluate the code produced by the other student. The evaluator will test the submitted code *for faults* and if it *meets the requirements* listed

*It was a grueling process but nonetheless a rewarding one*
